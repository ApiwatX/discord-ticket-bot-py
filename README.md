# Get Started
We suggest you be familiar with discord.py and python. This is a Ticket Bot guide so it couldn't contain a lot of python explanations.

## Install
First, we need to install the library [discord-components](https://devkiki7000.gitbook.io/discord-components/)

```
pip install --upgrade discord-components
```

If you meet an error `No matching distribution found for discord-components` when installing, try updating the python version! (It must be upper than 3.6)
